# DRAM Timing

TODO

tRCD: Row Address to Column Address Delay
CL: CAS latency
tRP: Row Precharge Time
tRAS: Row Active Time

RAS : Row Address Strobe
CAS : Column Address Strobe
TWR : Write Recovery Time, the time that must elapse between the last write command to a row and precharging it. Generally, TRAS = TRCD + TWR.
TRC : Row Cycle Time. TRC = TRAS + TRP.
